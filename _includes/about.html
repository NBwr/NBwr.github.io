      <h3 align="left">Data Scraping</h3>
      <p align="left">For the last couple of months I worked on a research project about the Evolution of Human and Machine Intelligence.
        I mostly contributed by scraping various data sources, cleaning, and reorganizing the data. <br />

        The research is still ongoing and will likely
      lead to a published Journal Paper in the next couple of months. At this point I can share the code and the data sets that contributed to the
    foundation of the research.

         Additionally, we take a closer look on the impact the feature importance has on each feature in the network. This work 
        will likely lead to a Blog post in the near future.

      <p align="left">
        A few months ago I co-produced a few online courses on Statistics and Econometrics. 
        The courses provide material to revise the concepts you would encounter in a typical "Statistics I", "Statistics II" and "Introduction to Econometrics" course. <br />

        Flutter is a UI toolkit for building iOS and Android applications at the same time. 
        Using the App you can add tasks, check them off and delete them after you are done. <br />

        As part of the Applied Data Science exam I built a Recurrent Neural Network to predict Amazon ratings based on the written text review.

          As part of the preprocessing step any non-alphabetic characters, HTML tags, etc were removed. Additionally tokenization and lemmatization was applied.
          For the Word2Vec implementation gensim was used. The RNN outperformed a simple Neural Netowrk and the benchmark model (simple Logistic Regression).

      <h3 align="left">Dimensionality Reduction on Mass Spectrometry Data</h3>
      <p align="left">
        Mass Spectrometry measures the mass of molecules in the body. The data obtained provides measurements of about 10,000 different molecules.
        That information may provide insights about diseases of a patient. 
         <br />
        As part of the Machine Learning exam we were given an anonymised data set consisting of 100 patients. The task was to identify cancer-related 
        proteins or combinations of proteins. As only a small number of proteins may influence diseases, the main task was dimensionality reduction. <br />
